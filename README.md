# Expense Tracker

## https://lfd-expense-tracker.netlify.app/

This web application allows users to track their income and expenses. Users can get a visual representation of their earnings and spendings with the help of these dynamic charts. Users have the option to implement their income/expense verbally through the speech functionality of this app. This feature was made available through Speechly's API.

## How it works

Users can pick from the variety of different income and expense categories, and input the amount and the date for that transaction. The app will automatically update the charts and the history list below.
<br>
Users can also ditch the keyboard and hold down the Speechly icon to state the income or expense (there is an example script provided for the users to use). This functionality works on the desktop and mobile.
<br>
Lastly, users can delete transactions if it is no longer relavant or if it is a mistake.

## Set up

run npm i && npm start inside client and server folder
